# Race Classification using YOLOv4-tiny on AMB82-mini

This repository contains a lightweight object detection and classification model designed to distinguish between three racial categories: **Asian, Black, and White**. 

The project leverages the **YOLOv4-tiny** architecture, optimized specifically for edge computing on the **Realtek AMB82-mini**, a low-cost AIoT development board. This demonstrates the feasibility of running real-time, AI-driven computer vision tasks on highly constrained, affordable edge devices.

## 🌟 Features
* **Edge AI Computation:** Runs entirely on the edge without requiring a continuous cloud connection, ensuring low latency and privacy.
* **Lightweight Model:** Utilizes YOLOv4-tiny, striking an ideal balance between inference speed and accuracy for resource-constrained hardware.
* **Three-Class Detection:** Trained to recognize and classify three categories: `Asian`, `Black`, and `White`.
* **Cost-Effective Deployment:** Built for the Realtek AMB82-mini, proving that advanced computer vision can be deployed on budget-friendly development boards.

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements
* [Realtek AMB82-mini] AIoT Video Development Board
* Micro USB Cable (for power and programming)

* 💻 Usage
* Use arduino IDE to deploy the model on AMB82-mini.

* ⚠️ Disclaimer
This model is intended for educational and research purposes. Please ensure that the use of demographic classification models complies with local privacy laws and ethical guidelines regarding AI bias and fairness.
